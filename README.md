The game has an npc and some monsters. The npc can ask you any question, if you can give the correct answer then the npc will increase your level difficulty. Otherwise if you give the wrong answer the monsters can steal your coin.

Depending on the level difficulty there will be more or less coins/monsters.
There are three level available now. Easy, Medium and Hard. In the easy level you will have less coins and not any monsters. The Medium level is the standard level where you can have a good amount of coins and not too many monsters. In the Hard level you can have a lot of coins and the most amount of monsters.

If you finish the game on an easy level you will get a bad ending. If you finish on a medium level that is an average ending, finishing on the hardest level gets you the best ending.
